# K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Examples of kNN with Wine data

This repository is meant to provide an example of implementing a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm in R.  We will predict the wine quality of both red and white wine! 

**k-Nearest Neighbors**: Uses a similarity measure (distance function) to predict the class of a record using the closest 'n' neighbors. 

## Getting Started

You can access the data from the UCI Machine Learning repository (linked below) by following along with the R code.  
[Red Wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv)  
[White Wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv)

Alternatively, you can save the 2 files in this repository to your working directory to follow along:  
("RedWine_Quality.csv" and "WhiteWine_Quality.csv").
  
If using this code within R Studio, collapse all sections by pressing Alt + O for easier navigation between sections.
